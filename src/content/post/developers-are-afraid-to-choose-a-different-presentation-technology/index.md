[Paul Stovell](http://www.paulstovell.com) wrote [a very interesting post](http://www.paulstovell.com/presentation-technologies) about choosing when to use HTML, Silverlight or WPF. In the comments, I noticed something that keeps coming back: WPF/Silverlight devs bashing HTML/Javascript as inferior and vice versa.

I’ve heard these discussions a lot and in most cases, people’s preferences are based on the technology that they are most proficient in and not based on facts. The only fact here is that it’s awkward to leave your comfort zone and learn something that is totally different conceptually (stateful vs. stateless).

So when you ask a developer which presentation technology to choose, you should also weigh his background.
