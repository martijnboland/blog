The [post about paging in ASP.NET MVC](https://blogs.taiga.nl/martijn/2008/08/27/paging-with-asp.net-mvc) still gets many hits, but the demo was created with ASP.NET MVC preview 5, so therefore I upgraded the demo to ASP.NET MVC Beta. I also removed a little bug that occurred when paging an already filtered list.

[You can download the updated demo here](https://blogs.taiga.nl/martijn/wp-content/uploads/subtext/mvcpaging-mvc-beta.zip).
