Hi, my name is Martijn Boland. For a living, I develop software and try to help other people building better software. Together with Erwin Berends, I own a little software company in the Netherlands called [Taiga](http://taiga.nl). I'm also the lead developer of the [Cuyahoga CMS project](http://cuyahoga-project.org).

In this blog, I'm mainly going to write about the technical stuff that I'm encountering on a day-to-day basis. Currently I'm especially interested in the things that [ALT.NET](http://altnetpedia.com) adds to the Microsoft .NET environment, so you can expect some posts in that area.
