It’s now possible to add the [MVC pager](https://github.com/martijnboland/MvcPaging) to your own project with [NuGet](http://nuget.org/).

Or from Visual Studio with ‘Manage NuGet Packages...’ and then search for ‘MvcPaging’.

After installing, you can immediately use the Pager HtmlHelper in your views:
