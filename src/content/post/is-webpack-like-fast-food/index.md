[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is a module bundling tool for packaging apps. I am using it more and more, even to the point where it almost entirely has replaced my previous [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) build environments.

But here’s the thing: I still don’t feel entirely comfortable using webpack. I wonder if it’s only me, or are there more people feeling the same?  
To me, it’s still this magic box with a gazillion configuration options (which, in fact, you almost don’t need), awful documentation and a single core developer. You know, things that _usually_ make you feel uncomfortable.

But man, you can do crazy things with it so fast! Almost like fast food. Instant gratification with perhaps a little bad taste afterwards.
