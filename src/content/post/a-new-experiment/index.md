Last week, I started to do some serious [Cuyahoga](http://cuyahoga-project.org) development again and I'm going to try a new development methodology: [blog-driven-development](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2006/03/31/ANewMethodologyBlogDrivenDevelopment20.aspx). A few days of development brought up so many interesting things, so I decided that I might as well write about them (in fact, I already started it because [this post](https://blogs.taiga.nl/martijn/archive/2008/11/20/nhibernate-criteria-queries-across-multiple-many-many-associations.aspx) was also triggered by Cuyahoga development).

In the near future, I'll be writing about the following topics:

- adding an ASP.NET MVC application to your [legacy Webforms application](http://cuyahoga-project.org);
- running the same legacy application in IIS 7.0 integrated mode;
- a multi-part post about validation with [Castle validators](http://hammett.castleproject.org/?p=114) and ASP.NET MVC;
- any other interesting topic that comes up during development.
