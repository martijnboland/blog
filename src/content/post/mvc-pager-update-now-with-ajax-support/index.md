The [MVC pager](https://blogs.taiga.nl/martijn/2008/08/27/paging-with-aspnet-mvc/) now has support for AJAX scenarioâ€™s, thanks to [Bart Lenaerts](https://github.com/blenaerts). This was my first [GitHub](https://github.com) pull request and everything went pretty smoothly.

Check out the demo application for an example. Visit the [GitHub project](https://github.com/martijnboland/MvcPaging) page to download the solution.
